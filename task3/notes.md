# Docker containers as agents - controller as executor

Using Jenkins as a Docker container, this requires installation of Docker inside it.

Add jenkins user to the docker group: <code>usermod -aG docker jenkins</code>

Docker socket file should be mapped to that of the host:
Use <code>-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock</code> when running the <code>docker run</code> command

Docker group id inside the container should equal to the one of the host: <code>groupmod -g host_gid docker</code>

Use container agents in Jenkins script:

```
agent {
    docker {
        image 'name'
    }
}
```

# Docker containers as builder nodes

Use an image with a running SSH server.
Additionally, install required development tools.

Create a user which Jenkins controller will use to connect with the node.
For key pair login, add a public key to the user's .ssh/authorized_keys file.

If using known_hosts file verification, add the builder node to Jenkins .ssh/known_hosts file - <code>ssh-keyscan node_host >> known_hosts</code>

For the controller to connect with the node, use credentials created by adding the corresponding private key.

See Docker files in the docker directories for more.

Specify build agents by using labels. The controller will use the labeled node for executing the scripts.

```
agent {
    node {
        label 'maven'
    }
}
```
